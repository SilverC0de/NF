# NF
NFT backend for creating tokens

Following a tutorial on how to build an NFT, I ended up bulding it without using it, apparently, I could just upload an image on opensea.io and just sell it off.

Anyways, moving forward, I am not even sure i did a good job or this is utter rubbish, buh follow up, you might gain one or two.


You'll need Truffle, Ganache, Nodejs, Openzeppelin.

*clears throat* So, install Truffle and Ganache
After that, run *npm init*, enter those time wasting npm details, then run *truffle init*
Your truffle will start up, after that install Openzeppelin by running npm install *@openzeppelin/contracts*
Please try to install v3.4.0, that version is sane, the newer versions are psychopaths.

Copy code, I myself don't know what it does...

*truffle compile*
*truffle migrate*

I am tired.
